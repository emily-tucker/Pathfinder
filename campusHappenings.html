            If you’re in need of a good laugh, watching Awkward Fiction perform will do the trick. This campus group, spearheaded by Cole Wadsworth, who graduated in December 2014, performs roughly twice a semester. At their show on October 28, 2014, eleven actors participated in a variety of activities, including videos, games, and random improvisation.
Creating a highly interactive environment for the audience, the master of ceremonies, Carter Cain, encouraged audience members to participate and used their ideas to guide the show. <br /><br />
Wadsworth explained that Awkward Fiction is a great escape from reality for both the actors and the crowd. 
“It’s relaxing, stimulating, and a morale booster all at the same time,” he said. Some of the highlights of their show consisted of the Dating Game, Real Estate Agent, and Lines. During the Dating Game, a couple from the audience had to answer questions about their first date, and from there the actors performed an exaggerated version of the couple’s first date. <br /><br />
After, the troupe demonstrated Real Estate Agent, where the audience members would choose a random location, an actor from Awkward Fiction, and a volunteer. The chosen actor then became a real estate agent and tried to sell a property in Utah to the volunteer while the other performers acted within the scene. Then, as a wrap up, the group depicted lines that the crowd wrote down before the show using random scenes. <br /><br />
This student-led group started in 2011 and has only grown since then. The assembly is actually not considered a club, but practices several times a week and demonstrates their skill during shows. The performers range from choir singers to football players, ultimately creating a diverse and entertaining sense of humor. Awkward Fiction primarily focuses on improvisation, which is basically acting without preparation. Almost everything seen at their shows is original and off-the-cuff acting. <br /><br />
Performers show their improvisational skills through props, different scenes to perform, and people to act out. According to Wadsworth, it’s something people do all the time anyway.<br /><br />
“Improv is easy,” Wadsworth said. “Every conversation you have is improv. To be good enough for a performance, however, you have to be brave.” <br /><br />
The show relies on both audience members, and the actors’ creativity for a great show. To be successful, the actors must be able to not only make up one funny line, but also create a humor-filled environment throughout the show.<br /><br />

           Innovation. Creativity. Entrepreneurship. These words describe the tools people use to change the world. They also happen to make up the name of a new project on campus, the ICE Project. Chris Greene, a business professor at Western, is sponsoring the movement, and several student leaders are contributing ideas. 
           <br /><br />
Eventually, ICE plans to have an ‘ICEhouse’ on campus that will function as a place of connection for 
students of different majors, community members, as well as faculty. Those involved in the initiative envision the location as a coffee shop with beer on tap, with other space to allow creative juices to flow.<br /><br />
The program isn’t just for business majors, either. Its focus is on inspiring, connecting, and empowering people to make a change. 
“If you see a problem, you can do something about it,” Greene said about the project. “It’s rare to see someone that wants to make a change that also knows all of the steps necessary to make an impact, as well as how to complete those steps...and that’s where ICE comes in.”
Typical events that could be held at the ICEhouse include weekly coffee meet-ups for discussion, TED Talk Tuesdays, and several events throughout the year such as ‘ICEfest’ or innovation challenges during prospective student preview days.<br /><br />
Rob Wright, an involved Western alumnus and Foundation board member, donated to the cause and to the startup funds for the organization. 
“ICE is not just a Western program, it’s for the community of Gunnison and Crested Butte. We want to connect people,” Greene said. “The program will call its members ‘MountainMakers.’  MountainMakers are people that make music, skis, crafts, web codes, and much more. MountainMakers make businesses, nonprofits, and everything in between,” Greene continued. “It’s a template for change and it’s experimental.” 
The members of ICE made it clear that failing is a part of the process, as well as rejection—along with learning how to deal with both. Several of the student leaders were happy to share their thoughts about ICE. <br /><br />
“Empowering people excites them to be able to do what they want to do,” said Greg Graff, a business major in his junior year.<br /><br /> 
“We are in the process of getting apparel and ways to market that we exist. ICE is open to everyone, and we want everyone to feel welcome,” added Justin Hebert, another junior business major.<br /><br />
Currently, the project is looking for a home on campus, but due to other renovations and improvements to facilities, ICE will have to wait. 
“We are working hard towards having a collaborative space for campus to come together. The old Escalante Fitness Center could be the perfect place,” Greene said. “We’ve gained some community support on the idea and it could work well and end up being a marketing point for the valley.” <br /><br />
In April 2014, the Escalante Fitness Center was used as the location for the first-ever ICEfest. However, May 2016 would be the soonest that the ICE Project could be able to start working in the Escalante space, but the program certainly hopes to make an impact on the campus and the community with other upcoming developments.<br /><br />
“Next fall, hopefully some curriculum changes will occur, allowing students to gain an ICE degree, or WILD (Western Innovation Leadership and Development) certificate,” Greene said.<br /><br />

Biography:<br /><br />
Hello, my name is Graham Ruhmann, and I am currently in my fourth and final year at Western. I was born in St. Louis, Missouri, but moved to Colorado at the age of 11. I greatly enjoy being outside and have always been a fairly active person. Mountain biking has been a somewhat new hobby of mine, and racing for the Western team has given me the opportunity to see some really neat parts of the state. Throughout my collegiate career I have been fascinated with the fields of biology and chemistry. The challenges and applications of these fields led me to pursue a double major in cell biology and biochemistry. After graduating from Western I would like continue exploring these fields by entering a graduate program. Although I do not have clear career plans, teaching has been in the back of my mind as a career that would be both interesting and fulfilling.  <br /><br />

Abstract<br /><br />
Recent studies have raised concern about the effects of EDCs on many different species due to the ubiquitous nature of these compounds and the hormone mimicking action they have on organisms. Aquatic ecosystems are especially vulnerable to EDC exposure because many of these compounds are not water soluble, allowing the compounds to migrate in agricultural runoff and industrial waste. Methoxychlor (MXC) is an endocrine disruptor that was developed as a pesticide to replace DDT, and has been found in low concentrations in various waterways. Acting as an estrogenic and anti-androgenic compound in vertebrates, MXC can cause a cornucopia of deleterious effects. A particularly harmful effect of MXC involves epigenetic alterations to the genome of the organism exposed to MXC, which can subsequently alter the genome of the progeny of that organism. The group of genes called fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) is pivotal to the proper development of all vertebrates, including Xenopus laevis, the model organism used in this study. Previous research that involved treating Xenopus laevis embryos with endocrine disruptors, including MXC, caused the froglets to have altered swimming behavior which could be linked to malformed neural circuits that rely upon proper migration and differentiation of neural crest-derived Rohon-Beard sensory neurons. For this study, the regulation of the FGF-2 gene in Xenopus laevis embryos will be quantified using the RT-qPCR machine. Embryos from the adult mating pairs that have been treated with MXC will be used to observe FGF-2 gene regulation between the control and treatment groups. Examining the gene regulation effects of MXC on Xenopus laevis embryos could provide evidence for the developmental problems observed in previous studies, and provide insight into the effects of MXC on vertebrate development.<br /><br />

Research<br /><br />
I have been extremely lucky to be able to participate in undergraduate research throughout my years at Western through the Thornton Biology Research Program. The opportunity to work closely with professors and students further along in their academic careers will be an experience I cherish long after graduating from Western. All of the research I have been involved with revolves around examining the effects of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) on the model species Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog). This semester I am working with Dr. Cassandra Osborne and Dr. Shan Hays to examine the effects of a compound called methoxychlor on gene expression in Xenopus laevis.<br /><br /><br /><br />

         Concerts are meant to be full of raw emotion, and music is made to express the deepest thoughts of the soul.
Saturday night during Homecoming weekend 2014, a tribute concert was held in remembrance of Music professor John Wacker. A well-known figure on campus, Dr. Wacker taught students to feel the rhythm to create beauty. Students and faculty alike admired his love for life 
and music. ><br /><br />
“Dr. Wacker lived with passion,” said Lily Olsen, a former student of the late professor. Wacker was the director of bands and taught at Western from 2005 
to 2014. He also served as the Chair of 
the Music Department for three years.  
He passed away in a tragic car accident on May 11, 2014, one day after graduation. 
Wacker was fifty - five years old 
and is survived by his wife and two 
children. The tribute concert was put 
on by the Music Department to honor him and his impact on the Western and Gunnison communities. ><br /><br />
The concert was composed of five 
musical groups from Western. The Steel Band opened the concert in the lobby of Quigley Hall, and after they had completed their set the Chamber Orchestra took the stage in the recital hall. Chamber Singers performed next before leading people out into the lobby for the High Altitude Dixieland Jazz Band. The concert closed in the band room with Varsity Band. The intention was for the audience to feel a rollercoaster of emotions from performance to performance, which was the reason behind the non-traditional performance flow.><br /><br /> 
People who knew Wacker spoke highly of his passion and love for the art of music. His favorite instrument was the trumpet, which was mentioned at the concert. To honor him, Varsity Band played Wacker’s favorite tune, with one of his students playing the solo that was traditionally saved for the professor himself. This moment was the most touching of the concert due to the raw emotion that was exposed and shared by everyone attending, and the tribute was clear. ><br /><br />
The Chamber Singers sang “And So It Goes,” which ended with: “and so it goes, and so it goes, and you’re the only one who knows”—a reference to the passion for music and the love story that entangles artists with their work. High Altitude Dixieland Jazz Band also played a song named “Blues for JW,” which they pointed out was specifically composed for Dr. Wacker. ><br /><br />
Western pride goes beyond the classroom, and at this event the community reached out to support and remember an amazing person. The legacy that was left behind was the most impactful element of the night. Passion for life, love, laughter, and music filled the halls. People say that Quigley Hall feels different this year, because the laughter and joyous trumpeting is eerily quiet. Yet, the Music Department carries on strong—with faculty determined to help students succeed by supporting them through this tragedy, ensuring that Dr. Wacker’s legacy will live on.><br /><br />

        <h2><a id="C5">Quigley Hall Renovation</a></h2>

        Western State Colorado University received almost $26 million in surplus funding from the State of Colorado in 2014 for the renovation of Quigley Hall. Due to an accelerated schedule, the project is slated for completion in a total timeframe of two years, rather than the four originally anticipated.<br /><br />  
On September 12, 2014, Western’s president, Dr. Gregory Salsbury, announced to faculty and staff via email that the Capital Development Committee of Colorado had approved the request for $25,779,853. Earlier in the year the funding had been put on hold, but extra revenue generated from sales tax in Colorado made it possible for the state to fund additional capital gains projects.
Associate Vice President of Finance and Administration, Julie Feier, was instrumental in getting the project off the ground. She said that Western receives most of its funding from the state through stipulations made each year in a document known as the Long Bill. Obtaining funding from the state involves a considerable process and takes a lot of time.<br /><br />  
After funds for the project were not obtained last year, the proposal for Quigley was resubmitted, along with a separate proposal for another project.<br /><br />  
“This year we actually put in for two projects, because my attitude was, if it’s going to take us this long, I’m going to develop the program plan for the library and get that project in the queue,” Feier said.<br /><br />   
When the funds for Quigley went through as a result of the unexpected funds, the Savage Library proposal automatically moved up in the order of priority. At the end of September, Feier stated that the Savage proposal was somewhere around eleventh on the list.<br /><br />  
The initial program plan for the Quigley project was first created in 2007, so the money has been a long time coming for many on campus, especially those in the Music and Art Departments, which are both housed in Quigley Hall. The structure was originally built in 1967 and has been in need of extensive repairs for years.<br /><br />  
“For being the Art Department, it’s one of the ugliest buildings on campus,” senior Art student Jeff Erwin said. Aesthetics aren’t the only concern, however.<br /><br />  
“Last spring after a heavy rain, I was weighing out minerals for a batch of glaze, when a ceiling panel fell, only a matter of feet from me,” he added.<br /><br />  
Erwin indicated that health and safety issues, including ventilation concerns, are a big part of why the funding was so badly needed. Feier echoed this sentiment by saying that the building appears to be in better shape than it actually is.<br /><br />  
“I always tout what a great job the facilities people do,” she said. “The problem is what’s behind the walls, what everyone else can’t see.” Feier said heating and plumbing systems need to be updated for comfort and safety.<br /><br />  
“I want the asbestos out of there. I want everyone working in a safe environment; I want the students in a safe environment,” she added.
Asbestos abatement will begin as early as May 2015, and demolition is scheduled to begin in August.<br /><br />  
A ten-member committee will be involved in the entire project from start to finish, including both an Art and a Music student. Projects on campus typically have a student representative, but Feier explained the need for two representatives for the Quigley project so as to reach both departments. Natalie Kuenzi is the Art student on the committee.<br /><br />  
“I am most excited for the students and the faculty who will be able to learn, create, and grow in a healthy building,” Kuenzi said via email. <br /><br />  
“I will always have a soft spot for the good ol’ Quigley I’ve worked in for the past four years, but it is so, so exciting that the Art and Music Departments will have a building that is fully functional and reflects the high level of work and talent here.”<br /><br />

        <h2><a id="C6">Western Partnership with Harlaxton College</a></h2>

         <p>
        Western State’s School of Business isn’t even a year old yet, but it’s already helping make new deals happen. 
Beginning this year, Western entered into a partnership agreement with Harlaxton College in the county of Lincolnshire in England. The program will give students from Gunnison the opportunity to study abroad in several unique ways.<br /><br />  
Dr. Peter Sherman was hired earlier this fall to be the Dean of the new School of Business. Western has typically had departments, not individual schools, and this is now the first of its kind at the university. Given the popularity of the Business Major around the country, it’s not a big surprise that Western is seeking to bolster its own program.<br /><br />  
“Previously it was the Department of Business, Accounting and Economics, and now it’s the School of Business,” Sherman said. “The most obvious change is that there’s now a Dean,” he continued. However, he added that Dr. Kevin Nelson is still doing much the same thing he was doing as the Chair of the Department before the change, but now, in addition to being the Chair, Nelson is also the Associate Dean of the new school.<br /><br />  
“My role is much more external,” Sherman said. “If I were to summarize it in one thing, it’s just about opportunities, and creating the opportunities for our students.” Sherman hopes to provide more support and resources that relate to careers for students.
One opportunity that has already materialized as a result of Sherman’s previous connections is this new partnership with Harlaxton College. The deal will be unique among Colorado institutions of higher education—in other words, no other schools in the state will offer the same program with Harlaxton.<br /><br />   
Harlaxton College is unique in part because of its location in an old English manor house, which was built in 1837 and is currently owned and operated by the University of Evansville. The partnership with Western will be in collaboration with the University of Evansville, where Sherman held the position as Dean of their School of Business prior to coming to Western. He has visited the college in England numerous times, both as a participant in the courses, and as a visiting professor.<br /><br />  
Studying abroad at Harlaxton College will ultimately take three different educational forms. Perhaps the most interesting and broadly appealing option is a full semester study-abroad experience in the U.K. at the manor. For the full semester abroad, students would still be eligible for any financial aid they receive here, making it an affordable opportunity.<br /><br />  
“The tuition will be similar to what it would be going to Western,” Sherman said. He added that most students take around 12 credit hours and attend classes Monday through Thursday, giving them time to experience the surrounding area. The program will be open to all majors, and although the core subjects are tailored to individual areas of study, the semester course does include six credit hours of British Studies. Three of those credit hours would fulfill one of Western State’s Liberal Arts General Education requirements under Area I.<br /><br />  
Students may also study abroad during a 10-day course in May, which will be similar to some of the other “Maymester” programs Western has offered in the past. During their stay, students in this program would be involved with intensive coursework, focused in contemporary European business. The in-country experience would also involve field trips to nearby areas of interest, including Nottingham.
The third option available to students will be a summer program, beginning with a “Tourism in Europe” course, taught by the Associate Dean of Western’s School of Business. The Maymester and summer programs for 2015 will kick off the new partnership.<br /><br />  
These three options are an initial foray into some of the types of opportunities that the new School of Business may open up for Western Students. Sherman stressed that the partnership is between the university as a whole, and not just the new school. The Dean seems to have his ambitions set high for the future as well, saying that part of what he hopes to do is “to increase salaries, placement rates, [and] the types of opportunities, and a lot of that involves bringing employers to campus.”<br /><br />  
As part of that effort, he mentioned that he would like to have more potential employers visit campus to meet with students, to talk and give presentations. In the past, there really has not been much of an emphasis on this kind of outreach, which means that Sherman has been taking a very hands-on approach so far.<br /><br />  
“To give you an example, there was a career fair for business students in Denver, and so I drove the students down there,” he said. To some, it might seem unusual that the Dean himself would step into such a role. <br /><br />  
Then again, the willingness to do whatever needs to be done may just be something that Sherman picked up while studying or teaching abroad himself.<br /><br />  
“I think a lot of students maybe haven’t given much thought to what opportunities [for studying abroad] might be out there because there just haven’t been what I would call standardized programs where it’s easy to,” Sherman said. “In terms of just why should we internationalize—it changes people. It transforms them in a positive way in terms of their self-efficacy, in the way they view just doing things here in the U.S.,” he continued, adding that it is also appealing to potential employers. <br /><br />  
“When I was teaching, I could actually walk into a room and almost pick out the people who had studied abroad. They just carried themselves in a different way.” Sherman said that things don’t always go perfectly when studying abroad, but that is part of what makes it a valuable experience—learning how to get out of jams and figuring things out. He also said that one of the best times to go abroad is as a student, before other things stand in the way.<br /><br />  
“You learn so much more about what’s happening in the world when you go to one of these countries, and what I have found is that, both for myself and with students, when you go to Brazil, or England, or China, that suddenly you find yourself watching the news and paying attention to those things that maybe you didn’t really even care about before. It heightens your interest as a lifetime learner, and so I think this is just the opportune time to go.”<br /><br />

         Western State used to compete regularly in NCAA skiing for Nordic and alpine events, which were both major attractions to the college; it just seemed to make sense here in the mountains to have a ski team. Then, in 2008 the program came to an abrupt halt — a sore spot ever since for the Gunnison community and alumni alike. <br /><br />  
In January, a new version of the ski team competed in their first event in Winter Park. <br /><br />  
“Team Western has done well for our first race,” racer Shelbie Ralston said via email after the event. “We do need improvement, but the way everyone has been practicing there will be a strong future for the Western Alpine Team.” Although not an NCAA team, the alpine racing team will compete in United States Collegiate Ski and Snowboard Association (USCSA) events under the umbrella of the Mountain Sports Program, which has already had Nordic athletes for several years.<br /><br />  
“My first competition was good,” Ralston continued. “Although I may not be where I want to be, it was only the first race of the season.”
She has been racing since she was six-years-old and was attracted to the team so she could continue her passion.<br /><br />  
For the first year back as a ski team the club sport consists of eight to nine members, all women. They have competed in Slalom and Giant Slalom. Downhill and Super G—both considered speed events— are not part of collegiate-level skiing at the club level, nor the NCAA.
Obviously, there is a lot of skiing to be had in the valley surrounding Western State Colorado University’s campus, and there always has been. But many people are not aware just how much of a role ski racing at Western has played over the years.<br /><br />  
Western’s ski team goes back as far as the 1946-1947 academic year when two 10th Mountain Division veterans launched the program. According to an article by History professor Duane Vandenbusche that appeared in the Colorado Central magazine in 2012, the team first trained at the local Pioneer Ski Area — home to the state’s first-ever chairlift. Later, in 1949, athletic director Paul Wright was instrumental in getting the NCAA to adopt skiing as a sanctioned collegiate sport. Western was at the forefront of college ski racing, making the loss of the program all the more poignant.<br /><br />  
Since those early days of skiing at Western, a number of skiers have gone on to be Olympians and NCAA champions. More recently, Sasha Rearick coached the U.S. Olympic Men’s Alpine Ski Team at the 2014 Olympics Games in Sochi. Rearick graduated from Western in 1999.
So why has the ski team come back now, of all times? According to Dave Wiens, Director of Mountain Sports, the timing just seems right.
“Alpine Ski Racing right now — it’s a pretty amazing time,” Wiens said. “Americans are right up there with the Austrians. They’re just doing really well.”<br /><br />  
National and international interest, coupled with support at the local level, including a personal donation of $5000 from Vandenbusche, have meant a big leg up for the long-awaited reintroduction of the team this season. Although the program originally seemed to lose traction at the administrative level from 2008-2014, there was never a shortage of enthusiasm from elsewhere. <br /><br />  
“In my mind, that’s neither here nor there now. Let’s just move forward and see what we can do,” Wiens said. <br /><br />  
He cited a change in leadership with both President Greg Salsbury and Athletic Director Jason Carmichael as a major reason why the program was able to get off the ground again. Racing in the USCSA circuit at the club level is a potential stepping-stone to what many hope will one day again become a full-fledged NCAA program.<br /><br />  
“I’m excited to see that Western has taken the initiative to come back to skiing,” said alumnus and former Western NCAA alpine racer Bo Maciejko. He said that there is probably a “long road ahead” that would require collaborative efforts between the school and alumni in order to get back to the NCAA level, but he hopes that this is a start. <br /><br />  
“I think that’s a step in the right direction. I think that the USCSA club division is going to be really good for Western. I’m excited to see how they do as far as competing this winter,” Maciejko said. <br /><br />  
During 2005-2008—the time that Maciejko competed on the ski team here—there were around thirty athletes between alpine and Nordic events combined.<br /><br />  
“I hope the Western alpine team in the future will eventually reach the potential of being an NCAA team once again,” Ralston said.<br /><br />  
“The USCSA is good for now, and maybe it’s good forever,” Wiens said, “but there are definitely some folks out there, alumni in particular, that have a history with our ski team. They want 
to see us back in the NCAA. I can understand that.”<br /><br />
